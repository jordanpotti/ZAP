# scripts
Description
I created this script as a side project at work. What it does:

1. Opens ZAP if it is not already open.

2. Starts Active scan on first URL from text file.

3. Saves the report to html file.

4. Sends report via gmail to an email.

5. Starts scanning next URL in text file.


This does require the python API module.

This is pretty shoddy python code I know.

It a quick and dirty way to scan a bunch of websites and have the reports sent via email.
